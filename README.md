# SMSAMI-Test

This project is using MySql database so include the import the .sql database file into your phpmyadmin <br />
To run the application first run "npm install" as usual <br />
Then run "npm run tsc" to complie the TypeScript files <br />
After that run "npm run start" to start the server <br />
The server will run on PORT: 4411 <br />
This was made in a short time so kindly ignore the unpleasant FrontEnd and the lack of comments <br />
No high level front end library is used for it either <br />
