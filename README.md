# SMSAMI-Test

This project is using MySql database<br />
Create a new Database in your phpmyadmin with name of smsamidb and import the smsamidb.sql database file into your phpmyadmin  <br />
To run the application first run "npm install" as usual <br />
Then run "npm run tsc" to complie the TypeScript files <br />
Do copy views folder from src into dist after compiling. This is done manually because I haven't used Gulp for it (I did try to implement it but it had some issues with how typescript was working) <br />
After that run "npm run start" to start the server <br />
The server will run on PORT: 4411 <br />
This was made in a short time so kindly ignore the unpleasant FrontEnd and the lack of comments <br />
No high level front end library is used for it either <br />
